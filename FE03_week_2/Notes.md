### What's difference transpiling and compiling

- Compilers
  - compiling is taking a source code in one programming language, and converting into output file in some other language
  - In practice we mostly use this term to describe a compiler such as gcc which takes in C code as input and produces a binary executable (machine code) as output.
- Transpilers
  - Transpilers are a subset of compilers
  - They are source to source compilers, they take the source code in one lang and convert into another source code file in some other language
  - The output is understandable by human
  - some example of traspiler is Babel
    - It transpiles ES6 code into ES5
      - where ES6 and ES5 are different versions or generations of js
