- In package.json
  - "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel",
    "build": "parcel build"
    }
  - when we run npm run start
    - it means we are executing the script called "start"
    - "npm start" will also work, but only in this case, npm build wont work

  - we did the same thing with
    - npx parcel index.html
  - to build
    - npm run build

- React element and DOM element are equivalent, but they are not the same
- React element is an obj
