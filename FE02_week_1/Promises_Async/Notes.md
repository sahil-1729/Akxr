#### Async
- something is going on but you don't want to wait until that thing is done, you want to continue while it's happening 
    - compared to synchronous programming, where we wait till its completely finished 
- earlier callbacks were used, until promises came
    - but now async await is introduced which is another way 
- promises me, we use .then method
